### In the Eskimo language `nanuk` means _polar bear._ When the tribe men go hunting they need to select
a leader, each men boasts on how many fish, elk or other animals he can hunt. Then they vote who will lead
them. A successful hunt for the leader is when they managed to hunt _as much as he boasted_ and the hunting
party managed to avoid a polar bear (_nanuk_) which can ruin a whole hunt. Experienced hunters know ways to
avoid polar bears using way stones to mark these areas.

### Finish the method called `hunt()` that will take three arguments: an `ArrayList<String>` `result`, `int` `
wayStones` and `int` `boast`. The method returns a boolean, about if the hunt was successful or not. Use the
guidelines below to determine if a hunt was successful or not. The `hunt()` method is already called in the main
method with an argument.

> The `results` will show either the number of catches on that path or nanuk
>
> The `wayStones` is the number of safe paths the leader knows to avoid nanuks. Each wayStone will help to
avoid one nanuk and cannot be used for future ones
>
> The `boast` is how much food the leader said he would be able to hunt.

> Return `true` when the hunt was successful: if hunters had enough `wayStones` to avoid all nanuks they
returned from the hunt with a hunt number more or equal to the `boast` number for the leader
>
> Return `false` if hunters encountered nanuk but did not have a wayStone to avoid it, or if the total
catches on the hunt was less than the `boast` amount

#### This is a `return` method with an `ArrayList<String>` and two `int` parameters

Main topics: methods, Scanner, ArrayList, wrapper classes

Example:
```
	nanuk(["1","2","3","5"],0,5)

output:
	true
	(no nanuks, and catches are 11 which is more than 5 that leader boasted)
```
Example:
```
	nanuk(["1","nanuk","3","5"],0,5)

output:
	false
	(They encountered nanuk but had 0 way stones)
```
Example:
```
	nanuk(["1","3"],0,5)

output:
	false
```
Example:
```
	nanuk(["1","10","3","nanuk"],2,7)

output:
	true
```
Example:
```
	nanuk(["1","10","3","nanuk","nanuk"],2,7)

output:
	true
```

Example:
```
	nanuk(["1","10","3","nanuk","nanuk","nanuk"],2,7)

output:
	false
```
